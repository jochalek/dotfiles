# Doom Emacs config

The creator of [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) says, "Emacs is an all consuming black hole. Its users doom themselves, eternally."

I have to agree. Anyway, I like emacs because it makes any text-based task extremely efficient, especially with vim-like key bindings from [evil-mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/eviluse). This leads me to try to do everything in emacs, because you pretty much can (read [extensibility](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/emacs/emacs.html)).

## I use emacs in the following ways: 
1. To study, by making flash cards quickly during lecture with [anki-editor](https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor).
2. To organize my life [in plain text](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html) following David Allen's [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) model.
3. To take [smart notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/) with [org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam).
4. To learn programing languages.

It seems emacs configs are forever under construction. As such mine is poorly documented. It has been largely inspired by [jethrokuan](https://github.com/jethrokuan) and [nobiot](https://github.com/nobiot).
